# Agricultural Crops and Livestock Analysis in Kenya - Year 2021/24

Project Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of agricultural commodities in Kenya, focusing on seasonal and perennial crops, livestock, salty water fish and fresh water fish. The ultimate goal is to offer actionable insights and recommendations to smallholder farmers, market linkage players, logistics providers, and retailers. By conducting time-series analyses on supply volumes and profitability, the project helps stakeholders optimize their operations and make informed decisions.

The analysis covers the period from 2021 to 2024, using a dataset that encompasses a wide range of commodities, markets, and regions within Kenya. The key categories of interest include:

- Seasonal Crops
- Perennial Crops
- Livestock
- Fresh Water Fish
- Salt Water Fish

## Objectives

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Address missing data, correct data types, and filter out irrelevant or erroneous entries.
Categorize the dataset into specific groups: seasonal crops, perennial crops, livestock, and fish.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identify key trends in supply volumes and profitability.
Analyze commodity performance across different markets and regions.

3. Time-Series Analysis:

Visualize trends in supply volumes, wholesale and retail prices over time.
Provide predictive insights into market performance based on historical data.

4. Actionable Insights for Smallholder Farmers, Market Linkage Players, Logistics Providers, and Retailers:

Based on trends and profitability, provide practical recommendations to help players in the agri-value chain maximize profits and make better business decisions.

## Data
The dataset covers the following key columns:
- `commodity`: The name of the agricultural product.
- `classification`: The class or grade of the agricultural product.
- `market`: The marketplace where the product is sold.
- `county`: The region where the market is located.
- `volume_supplied_tonnes`: The quantity of the commodity supplied (in kilograms).
- `wholesale_price_ksh`: The wholesale price in Kenyan Shillings (KSh).
- `retail_price_ksh`: The retail price in Kenyan Shillings (KSh).

## Notebooks
The analysis is split into the following sections:
1. **Preliminary Data Cleaning**: The first notebook, which handles raw data cleaning and splits the dataset into appropriate categories (e.g., seasonal crops, perennial crops, livestock).
2. **Seasonal Crops Analysis**: Provides a detailed time-series analysis of seasonal crops, focusing on trends in supply volume and profitability.
3. **Perennial Crops Analysis**: Conducts a similar time-series analysis for perennial crops, looking at production trends and market performance.
4. **Livestock Analysis**: Analyzes livestock products such as meat, eggs, milk, and hide, providing insights on supply volumes and market profitability.
5. **Fresh Water Fish Analysis** Investigates trends in the freshwater fish market, including volumes supplied and price trends.
6. **Salt Water Fish Analysis** Investigates trends in the Salt water fish market, including volumes supplied and price trends.
